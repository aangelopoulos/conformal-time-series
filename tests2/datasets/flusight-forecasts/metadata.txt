  Uses kernel conditional density estimation (using training seasons) to model
  the change in wILI from each time t to time t+1, conditioned on wILI at time
  t.  A small amount of smoothing is applied when calculating target
  distributions.  All training seasons precede the test season, and observations
  from the test season use mimicPastEpidataDF to approximate what the ILINet
  report for the forecast week looked like.  The code for generating these
  forecasts is available at https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epiforecast-R.
